# DoggoDec16
## About Project:
Re-iteration of or [DoggoDisplay01](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDisplay01). Written mostly to test my understanding and memory. Every line of code rewwritten with the intent to question if I have both understanding of individual lines of code and their functionality as well as testing the overall integration of different elements of the code (fine grained and coarse grained). No directory/file/class/function/variable written directly from the previous code without an attempt to produce it from my memory and with understanding of what it is and why.

*Dec17 note: I was not able to finish some of the testing code before the day ended (December 16). On December 17 I decided to restart this project from scratch and finish it within the day. Then I copied the missing bits into this project and crossed my fingers for a successful build on first attempt.* :fingers_crossed:

**Dec 18.. 'Second commit' note: Turns out copy pasting the code didn't work. The unit/widget tests for this project (Dec16) failed. Because I was testing for a button with the same functionality but using the button text from the Dec17 project. The Dec17 passed all the unit tests on first try... but it failed integration testing. So. I guess. Yeah. In the Dec 17 project it was just the wrong port number (I tried to access the mock api using the internal docker container port 8017 instead of the port the docker service exposes 3017. So that project push failed the deadline I set (before midnight dec 17/18) on a single digit (3017 vs 8017). Bawwwwww (Next time, I guess?).)**

***Dec 18........ .. 'Third commit' note: Sooooo... it turns out when working with listbuilder.. it is important to be transparent about the length of your list. Otherwise it might expect a longer list and look for something out of your range. Well. Transparency here I come. In any case. The Dec 17 project worked on second try. 23 minutes past midnight December 28. Single digit. 8017 vs 3017. Simple mistakes are so pretty to be honest (although I try to avoid them, at least professionally).***

***Tertiary note dec18 third commit.. pushing two ghcr images and 4 projects within the span of 15 minutes.. then debugging the 2 projects that failed and successfully resolving them within 30~ish minutes is hecking fun.

Uses [MockDogApiDec16](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApi16) as a mock api image for testing.

## Reflections:
Fun project. Lots of dopamine from from validating my recent learning experiences. I'm getting more flexible with my coding and what I am expressing with the code now. Less of a stick up my
