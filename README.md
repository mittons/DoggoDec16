# DoggoDec16
## About Project:
Re-iteration of or [DoggoDisplay01](https://github.com/mittons/DoggoDisplay01). Written mostly to test my understanding and memory. Every line of code rewwritten with the intent to question if I have both understanding of individual lines of code and their functionality as well as testing the overall integration of different elements of the code (fine grained and coarse grained). No directory/file/class/function/variable written directly from the previous code without an attempt to produce it from my memory and with understanding of what it is and why.

*Dec17 note: I was not able to finish some of the testing code before the day ended (December 16). On December 17 I decided to restart this project from scratch and finish it within the day. Then I copied the missing bits into this project and crossed my fingers for a successful build on first attempt.* :fingers_crossed:

Uses [MockDogApiDec16](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApi16) as a mock api image for testing.
